# Problem Statement

Early identification of patients at high risk of diabetes progression is essential for timely intervention and improved health outcomes. However, traditional screening methods may not effectively capture subtle patterns in patient data. This project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the risk of diabetes progression using clinical and physiological features. The model will serve as a decision-support tool to assist physicians in identifying at-risk individuals and prioritizing preventive care.
